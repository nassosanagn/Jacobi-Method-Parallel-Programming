# Jacobi-Method-Parallel-Programming

Parallel and serial implementations of Jacobi Method for solving systems of linear equations.

This project aims to compare serial, parallel and distributed implementations of the algorithm with different number of variables, cores, and threads.

How they scale? How about the speed up and efficiency?

In this project you'll find out:

- Serial version
- Parallel with pthread: creates and detroys threads on each iteration
- Improved pthread version: uses mutex and wait condition in order to syncrhonize and reuse threads
- OpenMP version
